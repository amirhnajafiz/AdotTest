        <h4>Improve User Experience Across Your Entire Site</h4>

        <pre>
            Let's kick things off with a brief explanation of what Google's goal as a search engine is.

            Just like any search engine, their objective is to find the best possible results for each user's query. 
            If they fail on this front, users are less likely to use the search engine again. 
            That said, Google does do this very well, which is why they're the largest search engine in the world - by far!

            You'll need to think about that constant desire to show the best results when you're optimizing your site for SEO.
            Why? The answer is simple: poor-quality sites are less likely to rank. 
            And Google's getting better at determining site quality.

            If your website looks untrustworthy, outdated, amateurish or is slow to load, potential users are likely to bounce back to the SERPs and click on another result. 
            You've lost a user and a potential conversion, and your bounce rate of affected pages is going to increase.

            Although Google hasn't officially declared it, there is evidence to suggest that the search engine giant does reward sites that have low bounce rates with better rankings.

            Google's reasoning is that if a user spends more time on a site, it's probably because they found it useful. 
            And since Google only wants to deliver the best possible results to its users, 
            it will push sites with strong engagement up in the search engine results pages.

        <h5>A Word on What a "Bounce" in SEO Actually Is ?</h5>
        
        <pre>
            A "bounce" occurs when a user lands on a page and then leaves without any other interaction. 
            The time spent on the page is irrelevant - all that matters is that a user has performed a single interaction on your site by visiting that page, and only that page.
            This means that a high bounce rate isn't necessarily a bad thing, which is probably why it hasn't been declared an official part of Google's algorithm - in isolation it's an unreliable metric. 
            For instance, if a user lands on your site in search of an answer to a specific question and then leaves because they've gotten what they've come for, to the user that's a good thing. 
            And what's good for the user, is good for Google.
