<h6>Improve User Experience Across Your Entire Site</h6>

<p>
    Let’s kick things off with a brief explanation of what Google’s goal as a search engine is.

    Just like any search engine, their objective is to find the best possible results for each user's query. 
    If they fail on this front, users are less likely to use the search engine again. 
    That said, Google does do this very well, which is why they’re the largest search engine in the world — by far!
    
    You’ll need to think about that constant desire to show the best results when you’re optimizing your site for SEO.
    Why? The answer is simple: poor-quality sites are less likely to rank. 
    And Google’s getting better at determining site quality.

    If your website looks untrustworthy, outdated, amateurish or is slow to load, potential users are likely to bounce back to the SERPs and click on another result. 
    You’ve lost a user and a potential conversion, and your bounce rate of affected pages is going to increase.

    Although Google hasn’t officially declared it, there is evidence to suggest that the search engine giant does reward sites that have low bounce rates with better rankings.
    
    Google’s reasoning is that if a user spends more time on a site, it’s probably because they found it useful. 
    And since Google only wants to deliver the best possible results to its users, 
    it will push sites with strong engagement up in the search engine results pages.
